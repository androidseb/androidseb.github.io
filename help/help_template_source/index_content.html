				<h1>Using markers, lines and polygons</h1>


				<h2>Creating markers</h2>
				<p>To create a new marker, click on the add button from the main map interface, then move the map around to place the target
					where you want to place the marker. When the target is at the desired location, click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to place the
					marker.
				</p>

				<h2>Creating lines</h2>
				<p>To create a new line, click on the add button from the main map interface and then click the line button on the left.
					Place new points with the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button, move from one point to another with the arrow buttons and click the
					save button when you&rsquo;re done.</p>

				<p>To create a new polygon, click on the add button from the main map interface and then click the polygon button on the
					left. Place new points with the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button, move from one point to another with the arrow buttons and click
					the save button when you&rsquo;re done.</p>

				<h2>Editing markers, lines and polygons</h2>
				<p>To edit a marker, a line or a polygon, start by selecting it (by clicking on it for example) and hit the edit button
					of the info window showing up. This will open the marker edit page. From there you will be able to edit all the attributes
					of the marker. Note: if you&rsquo;re editing a line or polygon, you will have the option to edit the points of the line
					or polygons from this page by clicking the &ldquo;edit&rdquo; button in the &ldquo;Coordinates&rdquo; section.</p>

				<h2>Deleting markers, lines and polygons</h2>
				<p>To delete one marker:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>select the marker (by clicking it for example)</li>
					<li>click the edit button in the info window, this will open the marker edit page</li>
					<li class="devices_android">click the 3 dots at the top to bring up the menu</li>
					<li class="devices_android">select the delete option</li>
					<li class="devices_ios">scroll down to click on the delete button</li>
					<li class="devices_web">scroll down to click on the delete button</li>
					<li>confirm the deletion</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To delete multiple markers at once, you can use the organizer (see the "organizer" section from this help page)</p>


				<h1>Using the organizer</h1>
				<p>You can open the organizer by clicking the organize button from the top bar of the main page. The organizer will allow you to perform actions on multiple markers at once.</p>
				<p>At the top of the screenshot below, we can see from left to right:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Select all button: select all the markers in the list</li>
					<li>Move to folder button: move the selected markers to another folder</li>
					<li>Copy to folder button: move the selected markers to another folder</li>
					<li>Delete button: delete the selected markers</li>
				</ul>

				<img class="devices_web" src="images/web_screenshot_4.png" style="width: 600px" />


				<h1>Using map folders</h1>
				<p>You can use map folders to organize your markers into different sections. Things you can do with folders:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>create a folder</li>
					<li>&lrm;edit a folder</li>
					<li>&lrm;marker templates: custom fields</li>
					<li>&lrm;mass assign color</li>
					<li>&lrm;mass assign custom fields</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Create a folder</h2>
				<p>To create a folder:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>open the sidebar</li>
					<li>&lrm;click "Add folder"</li>
					<li>&lrm;enter the desired folder information</li>
					<li>&lrm;click ok to save the new folder</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Edit a folder</h2>
				<p>To edit a folder:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>open the sidebar</li>
					<li>&lrm;long press on the folder you wish to edit</li>
					<li>&lrm;modify the folder to your liking</li>
					<li>&lrm;click ok to save the changes</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Marker templates: custom fields</h2>
				<p>While creating or editing a folder, you can define custom fields into the folder. Those folder custom fields will act
					as a template: when creating a new marker with only one folder selected, if that folder has custom fields then the folder's
					custom fields will automatically be added to the newly created marker.</p>
				<p>To create a folder's custom fields from the folder create/edit page:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>click "more options"</li>
					<li>&lrm;select "add custom field"</li>
					<li>&lrm;edit the custom field to your liking and save it</li>
				</ol>
				<p>To edit a folder's custom fields from the folder create/edit page:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>click on the custom field from the custom fields list</li>
					<li>&lrm;edit the custom field to your liking and save it</li>
				</ol>

				<h2 class="devices_android">Mass assign color and custom fields</h2>
				<p>When changing a folder&rsquo;s color or custom fields, a prompt will offer you to mass-assign the color or custom fields
					to the markers inside that folder.</p>

				<h2>Presets, templates and bulk icons with folders</h2>
				<p>If you want markers to be automatically created with a specific combination of icon, color and custom fields you can
					achieve this through folders. Folders will act as templates for their children markers. To do this:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Create a folder</li>
					<li>Choose the icon, color and custom fields that you would like to see by default for new markers</li>
					<li>Save the folder</li>
					<li>Double click on the folder from the main menu to select only that folder</li>
					<li>And any new marker that you create will inherit its parent folder&rsquo;s attributes</li>
				</ol>

				<h1>FAQ</h1>

				<h2>How can I help with translations?</h2>
				<p>Follow the instructions on the github page for translations:
					<a href="https://github.com/androidseb/mapmarkerapptranslations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/androidseb/mapmarkerapptranslations</a>
				</p>

				<h2>I have a feature idea, how should I submit the idea?</h2>
				<p>First you should take a look at the Map Marker roadmap to see if the idea is not already there:</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://mapmarkerapp.com/wip.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://mapmarkerapp.com/wip.html</a>
				</p>
				<p>Then if the idea is not already submitted, you can send me an email and I&rsquo;ll check it out :-)</p>

				<h2>Why is Map Marker not a navigation app?</h2>
				<p>Navigation apps are complex and hard to get right, and there are already a lot of good navigation apps out there. I believe
					that as a single developer, the way I can provide most value with Map Marker is by focusing on the ability to organize
					your places, and have an easy way to start navigation into navigation-focused apps. Map Marker&rsquo;s focus is different
					from navigation.</p>

				<h2>How do I add locations on Google Maps?</h2>
				<p>Map Marker does not provide such features. Instead, try using one of those links:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.google.ca/mybusiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.ca/mybusiness</a>

					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>A place in Google Maps has wrong/inaccurate data, how do I fix it?</h2>
				<p>Map Marker does not interact with Google Maps data, instead, try using the Google platform:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>go on Google Maps from a desktop computer: </li>
					<li>click the location that needs fixing</li>
					<li>click "suggest an edit"</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="devices_ios">What should I know about the premium upgrade?</h1>
				<p>
					When you purchase the premium, it becomes available for life for your Apple account.
					The Apple account granted with the premium access is the one used to perform the purchase.
					Upon purchasing the premium, you will receive a confirmation email with an order number.
					From then on, you can use the premium on as many iOS devices as you want.
					However you will need to use the exact same Apple account to perform the installation of
					Map Marker on your other device.<br>
					To restore the premium on a newly installed iOS device:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open the side drawer by clicking the top left button on the main action bar</li>
					<li>Click premium</li>
					<li>Click "restore purchases"</li>
				</ol>
				<p>If these steps don't work you can send me your order number for confirmation and I will help you.</p>


				<h1 class="devices_android">Troubleshooting and known problems</h1>

				<h2>Problems with Google Earth</h2>
				<p>I am not aware of any KMZ format where Google Earth supports images for markers. That is why Map Marker exports the images
					into the KMZ file its own way, so only Map Marker can read back the images. If you have a KMZ sample file with images
					in markers working with Google Earth, I would gladly look into it, but for now I had to settle with the compromise&hellip;</p>

				<h2>Problems with Google My Maps</h2>
				<p>Google My Maps cannot import the KML/KMZ files produced by Map Marker if they contain the default folder, because it
					cannot handle an empty folder name. To work around this, you will need to import only one folder at a time, that is
					not the default folder.</p>

				<h2>Premium troubleshooting</h2>
				<p>When you purchase the premium, it becomes available for life for your Google account. The Google account granted with
					the premium access is the one used to perform the purchase. Upon purchasing the premium, you will receive a confirmation
					email with an order number. From then on, you can use the premium on as many devices as you want. However you will need
					to use the exact same Google account to perform the installation of Map Marker on your other device.</p>
				<p>If you cannot use the premium:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Backup your markers outside of the app</li>
					<li>Un-install the app</li>
					<li>&lrm;Open the Google play app</li>
					<li>Make sure you are signed in with your Google account owning the premium in the left drawer of the Google Play app</li>
					<li>Download and install Map Marker again</li>
				</ol>
				<p>If these steps don't work you can send me your order number for confirmation and I will help you.</p>
