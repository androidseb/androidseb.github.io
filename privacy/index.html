        The personal information collected by Map Marker falls under 2 categories:
        <ol>
            <li>

                <b>User search queries:</b> the search queries entered by the user when searching for places with a

        This privacy policy page will focus on <b>user geographic data</b> only. When using the third party places
        searche engines in Map Marker, depending on the search source you're using, you will need to refer to different

        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>How Map Marker collects info</h2>
    <p>
        The info is collected by Map Marker when the user inputs the info manually or imports the info as files or
        though other apps sharing features into Map Marker.
    </p>
    <h2>How we use your info</h2>
    <p>
        Map Marker uses the data locally on the device with the different Map Marker features (displaying the markers
        list, displaying markers on the map, etc.).
    </p>
    <h2>When we share your info</h2>
    <p>
        Map Marker does not share your information externally unless the user performs explicit actions to share or sync
        their data. In the case of the user manually sharing data from Map Marker, the exported data could be sent to
        any app on the device the user may choose to share with. In the case of sync, Map Marker allows the user to
        configure an automated sync with some cloud storage platforms: the user data is then shared by Map Marker with
        those cloud storage platforms.
    </p>
    <h2>What cloud storage platforms Map Marker can use</h2>
    <p>
        Currently Google Drive or Dropbox. When the user grants access to Map Marker to a cloud platform, that access is
        used solely to read/write geographic synced data.
    </p>
    <h2>How we store your info</h2>
    <p>
        Your info is stored by Map Marker locally on the device, or on the cloud storage platforms if the user chose to
        sync their data to these platforms.
    </p>
    <h2>Where your info lives</h2>
    <p>
        Your info lives on the device and on any cloud platform you explicitly configured Map Marker to sync to.
    </p>
    <h2>How long we keep your info</h2>
    <p>
        The info is kept on the device or on the cloud platforms as long as the user does not delete it manually.
