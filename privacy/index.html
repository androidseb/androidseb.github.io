    <h2>Personal info</h2>
    <p>The personal info collected by Map Marker is the list of geographic objects the user can enter into the app which can
        contain geographic coordinates as well as a title, a description, a phone number, a color and associated images or
        media.</p>
    <h2>How Map Marker collects info</h2>
    <p>The info is collected by Map Marker when the user inputs the info manually or imports the info as files or though other
        apps sharing features into Map Marker.</p>
    <h2>Tracking technologies</h2>
    <p>Map Marker uses Google Analytics to track all actions performed in the interface. The data collected by Google Analytics
        is anonymous and does not contain any personal information, or any data/text/coordinates entered by the user.</p>
    <h2>How we use your info</h2>
    <p>Map Marker uses the data locally on the device with the different Map Marker features (displaying the markers list, displaying
        markers on the map, etc.).</p>
    <h2>When we share your info</h2>
    <p>Map Marker does not share your information externally unless the user performs explicit actions to share or sync their
        data. In the case of the user manually sharing data from Map Marker, the exported data could be sent to any app on
        the phone the user may choose to share with. In the case of sync, Map Marker allows the user to configure an automated
        sync with some cloud storage platforms: the user data is then shared by Map Marker with those cloud storage platforms.</p>
    <h2>What cloud storage platforms Map Marker can use</h2>
    <p>Currently Google Drive or Dropbox. When the user grants access to Map Marker to a cloud platform, that access is used
        solely to read/write geographic synced data.</p>
    <h2>How we store your info</h2>
    <p>Your info is stored by Map Marker locally on the device, or on the cloud storage platforms if the user chose to sync
        their data to these platforms.</p>
    <h2>Where your info lives</h2>
    <p>Your info lives on the device and on any cloud platform you explicitly configured Map Marker to sync to.</p>
    <h2>How long we keep your info</h2>
    <p>The info is kept on the device or on the cloud platforms as long as the user does not delete it manually.</p>
    <h2>Contact me</h2>
    <p>You can contact me with any questions at theandroidseb@gmail.com</p>
