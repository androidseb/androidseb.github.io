	<h1>Map Marker Roadmap</h1>
	<p>Note: this is my mindset at the moment, not a promise. I use the prefix "iOS/Web feature gap" for features already in the
		Android app but not implemented in the iOS app and the web app</p>
	<h2>Currently working on...</h2>
		<li>
			Investigating some technology to make the app development faster: Flutter.
			I might be switching to that, and if I do, there will be a significant time without new features as I rebuild the app.
			The end goal is that if I do, it will make future feature development way faster after.
			Currently when I build features, I have to build them in 2 separate projects: "Android" and "React Native" (iOS + Web).
			With flutter, I might be able to have a single project and limit the duplicate work.
		</li>
	<h3>Next ideas</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Track recording: recording the device location over time as one POI entry</li>
		<li>Quick actions: ability to modify a marker and its custom fields without entering the edit page</li>
		<li>Bulk addess import: street addresses / postal code import without lat/lng information</li>
		<li>Route planning: optimal route calculation + starting navigation with multiple markers</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Other good ideas</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Bringing other missing features from Android to iOS</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Floating marker titles</li>
			<li>Coordinates window + manual coordinates entering</li>
		</ul>
		<li>KMZ web images import: downloading web images from a third-party KMZ while importing it</li>
		<li>tags for markers with search by tag</li>
		<li>better offline maps</li>
		<li>quick picture mode (setting to open directly camera, or gallery, or camera internally)</li>
		<li>pictures annotations (shapes, arrow, text, etc.)</li>
		<li>print marker to PDF, with map, snapshot, title, description, etc.</li>
		<li>snackbar for cancelling marker deletion</li>
		<li>new marker title/description pre-fill parameters: address, date, time, number, folder name, arbitrary string</li>
		<li>unfoldable folders in the left panel allowing a quick navigation to markers</li>
		<li>have the possibility to hide folders from the tree, accessible from a "hidden folders" sub-list</li>
		<li>color auto assign for new created folders</li>
		<li>make the system bar and the navigation bar transparent so that we can see the map through it</li>
		<li>voice notes</li>
		<li>left handed mode (showing the action buttons at the left)</li>
		<li>have different sort options (once more fields are added to markers: title, description, creation date, any other date, distance to current location, distance to specific marker, etc.)</li>
		<li>more actions based on multiple markers selection (send phone, send email, etc.)</li>
		<li>SMS mass sending with number in selected markers</li>
		<li>Search filter to filter displayed markers on the map</li>
		<li>Export all images of a marker</li>
		<li>Read out marker info (voice synth) on marker select</li>
		<li>Bluetooth sharing with Garmin or TomTom GPS devices</li>
		<li>Widget to mark current location</li>
		<li>Alarm when nearing a POI</li>
		<li>Make map snapshots larger than the screen</li>
		<li>Auto address filling in marker creation</li>
		<li>Altitude lookup for markers</li>
		<li>Temperature lookup for markers</li>
		<li>GPX import/export</li>
		<li>UTM import/export</li>
		<li>Pinning folders: arbitrary ordering</li>
		<li>Folders auto collapsing with setting</li>
		<li>Renaming search result before adding to the map</li>
		<li>Smarter camera re-positioning when switching map file</li>
		<li>When guiding to a marker, draw a straight line to destination</li>
		<li>Share action to have the list of folders with checkboxes instead of one menu item per folder</li>
		<li>Start navigation between 2 points, not from current location</li>
		<li>Add a calendar reminder for a marker, with Google calendar integration</li>
		<li>Proximity alert: display a notification when nearing a given marker</li>
		<li>Attaching any file type to a marker, not only images</li>
	</ul>
